**ePub Major Ideas**

*Minimalist and aesthetic interface*
-We streamlined menu items by getting rid of pictures for each menu item (idea from initial design), and putting some photos underneath that menu page's header (2 salads underneath the salads header)
-Simple colors (grey, whites, blacks)
-Only critical information about the pub is displayed

*Consistency and clarity*
-There is a green V icon consistently used to mark that specific menu items are compatible with a vegetarian diet; the same icon is used to mark all vegetarian items
-We decided to use blue for buttons (cart, checkout, sign in) to visibly differentiate between actions

*User control and freedom*
-We updated the cart functionality so that users can update the quantity of their items and delete items
  -When conducting our inspection of our design with Nielsen's Heuristics, we identified that our initial design did not have functionality to delete items so we made sure to incorporate this in our final design

*Customization*
-We added a text box to our checkout where users can write in order specifications (e.g. ketchup on the side)
  -After conducting our usability testing, it was clear that we needed to incorporate easy-to-use customization functionality to our design

*Match between system and the real world*
-The menu is organized like the pubâ€™s menu is organized on the Bowdoin website: organized by different types of items (appetizers, salads), item name and price displayed on same line with a bar in between
-The add to cart functionality and checkout cart in the upper right icon are similar to popular e-commerce sites like Amazon

*Help and documentation*
-The FAQs page provides answers/instructions as to how to do things on the website that users (especially the first time) might not know how to use
