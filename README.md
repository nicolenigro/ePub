**How to configure our project:**
1. Clone this repository onto your computer
2. Open the terminal
3. Change your directory to the folder you stored this project in: cd Documents/GitHub/ePub
4. Run the contents of your directory on a local web server with the command: python -m SimpleHTTPServer
5. Copy and paste this URL into a web browser: http://localhost:8000/
Once the page loads, you should be able to see ePub's home page (index.html)

**How to use our project:**

*On our home page, we have links to other pages on right part of the header bar*
- the About page has some information about our idea for ePub
- the Menu page has links under the centered menu label to different parts of the menu
- the Contact page has the phone # and address of the Jack Magee's Pub
- the FAQs page has answers to some common questions like "How do I get my food when it's ready?"
- the My Account page has previous orders saved so that you can reorder them upon pressing the blue reorder button
- the Sign In page lets users who have accounts made sign in with their username and password so that their order information can be saved/accessed
- the Cart popup shows users what is currently in their cart

*The main task users will use our project for is ordering items. Here is a guide to ordering an item on ePub:*
1. Click on the menu page.
2. Click on a link under the centered menu header to a specific menu item page (e.g. clicking on the salads label will take you to the salads page where we list all of the salads you can order from Jack Magee's Pub).
3. Once you find the item you want to order, click on that item's blue add to cart button.
4. If you want to make any changes to your cart, click on the blue Cart button in the top right corner of the website. This will trigger a cart popup which will list the items in your cart and their quantity. You can increase or decrease the quantity of different items as well as remove items completely from your cart. You can press the X in the upper right corner of the popup or the grey Close button on the bottom of the pop up to close the cart popup.
5. When you are ready to check out, click on the blue Cart button and then click on the blue Checkout button in the bottom right corner of the cart popup.
6. The previous step will take you to the checkout page. Here, you will be prompted to enter your first name, last name, email, order comments and spceifications (e.g. no pickles), and form of payment. You can also review your order and make any last minute changes to it. When you have finished entering your info and reviewing your order, click on the blue place order button. 
7. Now your order has been placed! This will link to an order confirmation page that gives you your order number (which you can tell the pub cashier when you go to pay and pick it up) as well as an estimate for when your order will be done.
