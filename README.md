# PQ4: Build your Working Prototype
Ana√Øs Sarrazin, Emme McCabe & Nicole Nigro

This is our first implementation of our ePub online ordering service. We have compiled peer feedback and observations through our last 3 PQs, which have guided the transformation to our working prototype. The high-fidelity prototype we are building allows users to achieve the single goal of locating their intended food item and adding it to the cart. Secondly, we will include pick-up instructions and erroneous order conflict resolution. The design is not yet optimized in terms of design aesthetics or efficiency.
