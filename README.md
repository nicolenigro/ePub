# PQ4: Build your Working Prototype

Now that we have gathered a lot of information about our design and domain, we will start coding. You do not need to develop a full and complete implementation for your vision (although the more you can achieve, the better!). Instead, use your past party quests (PQs 1-3) and the observations you gain through peer review of your latest most polished design representation to guide your first implementation.

At minimum, aim to have a high-fidelity prototype that permits the user to achieve a single goal that is core to your system. This does not have to be optimized in terms of design or any other qualities, but the core functionality needed to support at least one user goal should be in place.
